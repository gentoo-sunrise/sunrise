  scheme2c-9999.ebuild:
  KEYWORDS should still be empty

  24 Feb 2009; Andrei Barbu (andrei) <andrei@0xab.com> scheme2c-9999.ebuild:
  Fix sed script that was broken by 7950, add keywords back. Keywords are
  important to this ebuild, as everyone discussed and agreed on IRC when this
  ebuild was approved. There are plenty of other live ebuilds, over 250 in the
  official gentoo tree alone, that have keywords; this is nothing special and
  no policy exists that live ebuilds should have no keywords. Please read the
  gentoo ebuild policy handbook, it clearly states that live ebuilds may have
  keywords as long as they are masked with ~

  scheme2c-9999.ebuild, metadata.xml:
