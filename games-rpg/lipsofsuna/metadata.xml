	<longdescription>Lips of Suna is a tongue-in-cheek dungeon crawl game that
		takes place in the chaotic dungeons of Suna. The five intelligent
		races of the world descend to the dungeons with their goal to save
		the world from a conclusive disaster.
		In your journey to the depths of the dungeons, you will, among other
		things, have to fight creatures of different varieties, solve quests,
		explore new places, and craft custom items. Luckily you don't need to
		do all this alone since you can crawl the dungeons with your friends.
