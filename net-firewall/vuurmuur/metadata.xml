		Vuurmuur is a firewall manager built on top of iptables on Linux.

		It has a simple and easy to learn user interface that allows both simple 
		and complex configurations. The configuration can be fully made through 
		an Ncurses GUI, which allows secure remote administration over SSH or on 
		the console. Vuurmuur supports traffic shaping and has powerful monitoring 
		features, which allow the administrator to look at the logs, connections 
		and bandwidth usage in realtime.

		This ebuild contains the daemon, binaries and configs for Vuurmuur.
