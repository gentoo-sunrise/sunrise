<longdescription>Openoffice-infra is the opensource version of staroffice
with some extra patches from Infra-Resource and enhanced Russian support.
This ebuild allows you to compile it yourself. Unfortunately this
compilation can take up to a day depending on the speed of your
computer. It will however make a snappier openoffice than the binary
version</longdescription>
